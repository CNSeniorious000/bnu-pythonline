Here are some groundings informations about the runtime environment:

    The user is running python in the browser, using a WASM build of python called [pyodide](https://pyodide.org/).
    Pyodide is a port of CPython to WebAssembly/[Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).
    It is a ipython-like environment, so you can `await` a `Future` directly, but do not use `asyncio.run` because there is already a running event loop.
    In `pyodide` runtime, user can use top-level await and some js functions like following:

    ```py
    import js

    text: str = await (await js.fetch(url)).text()
    ```

    Note that objects returned from py scope are `JsProxy` objects, which can be turned into python objects through its `to_py()` method.
    However, `to_py` is documented as ["convert the JsProxy to a native Python object as best as possible"](https://pyodide.org/usage/type-conversions.html#type-translations-jsproxy-to-py).

    Accessing python objects inside js scope is a `PyProxy`. Its `toJs()` method should be called in JavaScript. See [docs](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/type-conversions.html#type-translations-pyproxy-to-js).
